# House-price-prediction
## Introduction
A challenging choice is buying a house, particularly in a city like Bengaluru. Even though the most important ones are frequently the same for many metro regions, there are unique factors to take into account for India's Silicon Valley. It is difficult to determine the cost of a property in Bengaluru because of its millennial population, vibrant culture, beautiful surroundings, and availability of work opportunities.
## Objective of the project
Bangalore House Price Prediction model using a Machine Learning algorithm. This model predicts the price of Bangalore's house with the help of a few parameters like availability, size, total square feet, bath, location, etc.
## Steps involved
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Dealing with a missing values or noisy data
3. Data preprocessing
4. Create new features from existing features
5. Remove outliers
6. Data visualisation
7. Splitting data into the training and testing 
8. Train linear regression model and test.
9. Scaling of features
10.Train Support vector regression and test.
## Methodology  used
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Regression
## Results obtained
1. Using Multiple linear regression algorithm and I got R-square of 0.84 over the testing data.
2. Using Support Vector regression algorithm and I got R-square of 0.77 over the testing data.
